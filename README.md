CSC250 Homework Assignment #1

Assignment Details:

Write a Java program that defines a String variable and then creates a loop that goes through every character in the String and counts the number of vowels it finds.
Display the vowel count to the screen. 
Your string variable should hold the name of one of the Bible books in the new testament.
For example, if the variable held “Matthew” your program should display 2 since there are 2 vowels in that String.
Submit a link to your code on GitHub along with the self evaluation.
